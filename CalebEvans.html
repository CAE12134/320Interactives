        <p class="double">My name is Caleb Evans, and I am a sophomore at Northwestern University's renowned Medill School of Journalism, where I am passionately pursuing a career in sports journalism. My ultimate ambition is to become a sports feature writer, delving deep into the personal journeys and stories of athletes. Currently, as an active member of Northwestern's student sports radio station, WNUR Sports, I have had the privilege of providing play-by-play and color commentary for several Northwestern basketball and baseball games. In addition to my broadcast experience, I have meticulously crafted my portfolio page to showcase my work and dedication to sports journalism, reflecting both my skills and creative flair. Check out my resume for more about my accomplishments and projects.</p>

      <p class="caption">This video showcases my journey to Northwestern University. My life started in Columbia, Missouri where I lived until I was 9. My family moved to Maryland in 2014 to be closer to my Grandparents (my mom's parents). So, we lived in Huntingtown, Maryland with them for a year until we moved 15 minutes south to Prince Frederick, Maryland.</p>
